     <p id="welcome">Welcome!<br>  Thanks for stopping by.  I created this site to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript and
while doing so I stumbled upon so many languages, tools, and new tehnologies that I didn't know 
where to begin.  While this page is still for learning HTML/CSS/Javascript, I will be adding
other content as I learn.

Again, thanks for stopping by.
